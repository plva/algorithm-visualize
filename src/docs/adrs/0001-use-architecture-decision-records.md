# ADR 0001: Use Architecture Decision Records

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As we build a comprehensive algorithm visualization platform with multiple problems, solutions, and visualization types, we need a way to:
- Document important architectural decisions
- Explain the reasoning behind design choices
- Provide context for future developers
- Track the evolution of our system design
- Ensure consistency across different problem implementations

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions in our algorithm visualization platform.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Clear documentation**: Each major decision is documented with context and reasoning
- **Historical context**: Future developers can understand why certain choices were made
- **Consistency**: Helps maintain consistent patterns across different problem implementations
- **Knowledge sharing**: Team members can quickly understand architectural decisions
- **Refactoring guidance**: Provides context when considering architectural changes

### Negative
- **Maintenance overhead**: Requires keeping ADRs up to date
- **Documentation debt**: Risk of ADRs becoming outdated
- **Initial setup time**: Time required to establish the ADR process

## Implementation
- ADRs will be stored in `src/docs/adrs/`
- Each ADR will follow the format: `XXXX-short-description.md`
- ADRs will be numbered sequentially starting from 0001
- Each ADR will include: Status, Context, Decision, Consequences
- ADRs will be referenced in code comments and documentation
