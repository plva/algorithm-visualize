# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Overview

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document significant architectural decisions in our algorithm visualization platform. They provide context for why certain design choices were made and help maintain consistency across the project.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

```markdown
# ADR XXXX: Short Descriptive Title

## Status
[Accepted | Proposed | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[Describe the problem or situation that led to this decision]

## Decision
[Describe the decision that was made]

## Consequences

### Positive
[Benefits of this decision]

### Negative
[Drawbacks or trade-offs of this decision]

## Implementation Details
[Optional: Technical details about how this decision is implemented]

## Alternatives Considered
[Optional: Other options that were evaluated]

## Related ADRs
[Optional: Only include ADRs with direct dependencies or strong conceptual relationships]
```

## Guidelines

### When to Create an ADR
- **Architectural decisions** that affect multiple components
- **Technology choices** that impact the entire system
- **Design patterns** that will be used consistently
- **Breaking changes** to existing architecture
- **Performance or scalability decisions** with long-term impact

### When NOT to Create an ADR
- **Implementation details** that don't affect architecture
- **Temporary decisions** that will be revisited soon
- **Minor refactoring** that doesn't change system design
- **Library updates** that don't change architecture

### Related ADRs Section

**Only include ADRs that have:**
- **Direct dependencies**: One ADR builds upon or requires another
- **Strong conceptual relationships**: Decisions that are tightly coupled
- **Conflicting approaches**: ADRs that represent alternative solutions to the same problem

**Do NOT include:**
- ADRs that are merely "related" or "similar"
- ADRs that happen to be in the same domain
- ADRs that don't have a direct architectural relationship

### Examples

**Good Related ADRs:**
- ADR 0002 (Event Log System) → ADR 0003 (State Management Strategy)
- ADR 0004 (Component Architecture) → ADR 0005 (Performance Optimization)

**Bad Related ADRs:**
- ADR 0001 (Use ADRs) → ADR 0002 (Event Log System) ❌
- ADR 0006 (UI Framework) → ADR 0007 (Testing Strategy) ❌

## Naming Convention

- **Format**: `XXXX-short-descriptive-title.md`
- **Numbering**: Sequential starting from 0001
- **Title**: Short, descriptive, in kebab-case
- **Example**: `0002-event-log-system.md`

## Maintenance

- **Keep ADRs up to date** when architecture changes
- **Deprecate ADRs** when decisions are superseded
- **Reference ADRs** in code comments and documentation
- **Review ADRs** during major refactoring efforts
